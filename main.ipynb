    "- The name column in players.csv is somewhat irrelavent as majority of the names are unique and that isnt representative of anything. It would be good to move the hashedEmail column to the first position in the dataset for readability. \n",
    "- Sessions.csv also has both a string and number representation of start and end times. A better representation would be to keep the string columns for start and end, and replace the number columns with a single column representing the total session time. This makes me belive it is raw data collected from the database as the number timestamps would be what was outputted automatically, and then reformatted as a string.\n",
