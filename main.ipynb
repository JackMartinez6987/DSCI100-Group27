    "- The name column in players.csv is somewhat irrelavent as majority of the names are unique and that isnt representative of anything. It would be good to move the hashedEmail column to the first position in the dataset for readability. \n",
    "- Sessions.csv also has both a string and number representation of start and end times. A better representation would be to keep the string columns for start and end, and replace the number columns with a single column representing the total session time. This makes me belive it is raw data collected from the database as the number timestamps would be what was outputted automatically, and then reformatted as a string.\n",
    "- Im not entirley sure what the subscribe column means in players"

    "### Methods and Plan\n",
    "I would use a K-Nearest-Neighbor model to predict experience level with age and hours played. \n",
    "- This is the most appropreate method of prediction as we are taking two **quantitative** predictors (Age, and played_hours), and predicting a **qualitative** (experience) classification\n",
    "- We need to assume that the data has been standardized and centered, aswell as that points with the same experience level will have similar ages and played hours\n",
    "- I dont believe there are many weaknesses to picking KNN for this problem. The predictors potentially could not be representative of the classification, but thats not a weakness of KNN, rather the varibles themselves.\n",
    "- I will use an initial split to split the data into training and testing sets. I will then make use of cross validation inorder to find the best K value for my KNN model. This allows me to train and test the model on all the data to find the most accurate K aswell as having a portion of data to test at the end to get my models statistics such as precision, recall, and accuracy.\n",
    "- Given the size of the dataset I would use 75% of the data for training and the remaining 25% for testing. I would also use five folds on the training set to pick the best K value. "
